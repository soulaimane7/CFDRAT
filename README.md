# CFDRAT â€” Master Fluid Simulation in Minutes with GUI and Examples ðŸŒŠðŸ§­

CFDRAT gives a compact, hands-on platform for learning and experimenting with incompressible flow solvers. It bundles a desktop GUI and MATLAB-ready scripts that run classic tests: lid-driven cavity, cylinder flow, and steady channel flow. The release package contains ready-to-run artifacts. Download the release file from https://github.com/soulaimane7/CFDRAT/releases, then run the included executable or MATLAB script to start.

## Example runs

All examples assume you downloaded and launched the release package or you run scripts in MATLAB.

Common parameters:
- Re = Reynolds number
- Nx Ã— Ny = grid points in x and y
- dt = time step
- T = physical simulation time

### Lid-driven cavity

Purpose: reproduce benchmark steady vortices and corner eddies.

Typical config:
- Domain: [0,1] Ã— [0,1]
- Boundary: top lid U = 1, other walls U = 0
- Method: projection on staggered grid, second-order central diff in space
- Example: Re = 1000, Nx = Ny = 128, dt = 0.002, T = 10.0

MATLAB command:
```matlab
params.Re = 1000;
params.Nx = 128; params.Ny = 128;
params.dt = 2.0e-3;
params.T = 10.0;
run_lid_driven_cavity(params)
```

Expected output:
- Velocity field with primary vortex at cavity center
- Secondary corner vortices appear at higher Re
- Diagnostic: u-velocity profile at vertical centerline and v-velocity at horizontal centerline

### Flow past a cylinder

Purpose: test transient vortex shedding, drag and lift computation.

Typical config:
- Domain: rectangular channel with embedded cylinder radius R
- Inlet: parabolic or uniform profile
- Outlet: zero-gradient pressure
- Cylinder: no-slip
- Example: Re = 100, Nx = 400, Ny = 120, dt = 1e-3, T = 8.0

MATLAB command:
```matlab
params.test = 'cylinder';
params.Re = 100;
params.Nx = 400; params.Ny = 120;
params.dt = 1.0e-3;
params.T = 8.0;
params.cylinder.R = 0.05; % normalized units
params.inlet.Umax = 1.0;
run_cylinder_flow(params)
```

Outputs:
- Time history of drag and lift coefficients
- Vorticity snapshots showing periodic vortex shedding
- Strouhal number estimate from lift signal FFT

## Numerical methods

CFDRAT implements a compact set of methods that focus on clarity and learning value.

- Grid: staggered (MAC) grid. Velocities live on face centers. Pressure lives at cell centers.
- Pressure-velocity coupling:
  - PISO for transient runs with inner correction loops
  - Projection method for weakly-compressible steps
- Spatial discretization:
  - Central differences for diffusion and pressure gradients (second-order)
  - Upwind/QUICK optional convection schemes for stability at high Re
- Time integration:
  - Explicit RK2 for convection
  - Implicit diffusion solve using simple iterative solvers
- Linear solvers:
  - Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and simple SOR for Poisson solves
  - Optional multigrid-like V-cycle (educational version)
- Boundary conditions:
  - Dirichlet for no-slip walls
  - Neumann for pressure at outlets
  - Periodic option for channel tests

Design choices:
- Make the code readable. Each solver step matches the theory in textbooks.
- Offer trade-offs between performance and clarity.
- Keep the solver stable for classroom-scale grids (up to ~500k cells).

## GUI guide

The GUI exposes solver controls and live plots.

Main panels:
- Setup
  - Choose test case (Lid-driven cavity, Cylinder, Channel)
  - Set Re, grid size, dt, end time
- Boundary
  - Set wall velocities, inlet profile, outlet type
- Solver
  - Choose method (PISO / Projection)
  - Set inner correction iterations and residual tolerance
- Run
  - Start, pause, stop
  - Save state
- Visualization
  - Toggle velocity vectors, streamlines, pressure contours, vorticity
  - Export PNG, animated GIF, and CSV logs

Common workflow:
1. Pick a test.
2. Choose grid and Re.
3. Tune dt to satisfy CFL < 0.5 (for explicit advection).
4. Click Run.
5. Use Export to save frames or data for post-processing.

Keyboard shortcuts
- R: Run/pause
- S: Save snapshot
- V: Toggle vectors
- L: Toggle streamlines

## Development & tests

- Use the MATLAB scripts in /src for step-by-step execution and testing.
- To run unit tests:
  - Open MATLAB and call `run_tests()` which executes consistency checks:
    - Mass conservation in steady state
    - Poisson solver residuals
    - Convergence of lid-driven cavity with grid refinement
- To add a solver:
  - Add files under /src/solver
  - Register the solver in solver_registry.m
  - Add a UI entry if you want it available in the GUI

Performance tips:
- Reduce dt for higher Re or refine convective scheme.
- Use coarser grid for initial runs, refine once you confirm behavior.
- For long transient runs, enable checkpointing to save state.
